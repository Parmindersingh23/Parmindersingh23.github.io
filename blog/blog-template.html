<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  Wire Framing with someone else went well. Having two different frame points for design helps. We both created our own designs and then we picked the best features to add into our design. Although everything was still very simple.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing is very helpful to have, since it gives a guideline to follow. With a wireframe there is some sort of frame of reference to follow.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We tried to keep it as simple as possible. Since we don't know too much in depth of html, we wanted to keep it simple and functional.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  I don't think we used any new elements.
