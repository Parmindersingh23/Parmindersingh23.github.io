  <h1>Week 3</h1>
  <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?</h2>
  <h4>09/28/15</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
Quick overview of what each of these things mean:

inline-block – a block box that allows another element to sit next to it on the same line
inline – allows another element to sit next to it on the same line, but does not format it into a block box.
<br>
<p>
  So bascially the inline will line up the block but it will lose two important features of that block. Width and height will be lost since the inline property doesn't format the block.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Inline-block will properly hold on to those properties and will format it in the correct way.
