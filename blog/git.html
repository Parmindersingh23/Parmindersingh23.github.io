     There is a lot I can write about Week 1, but I will keep it short since I am behind on work. Maybe I will come back and write more about it later.

     We learned about Git and Git Hub and how they work together and we can use Terminal to push and merge changes together.

     There are many benefits to using Github since a devolper can keep track of the many changes that are being made on files. They can also make their own branches and edit them and then re merge them to update the remote files. This way none of the master files get messed up.

     That is the main lesson I learned this week, I will try to come back and add more about it when I can.
