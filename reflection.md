#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned that they are really hard to manage without using templates. But you really have to have a good grasp of html and css knowledge to make everything work well.


#What did you learn about CSS positioning?

There are many different options of positioning in CSS. So learning on how all of them work together was difficult. But with trial and error you can get close to what you need. Some of the things I tried just wouldn't work and I had no idea why.


#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The most easiset was the font colors and styles. Positioning was the hardest.


#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It was difficult making the html and css elements to match. I was still not comfortable using all the differenct classes and ids within html and css.
